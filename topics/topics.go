// - "Topic name" is a / separated string that could contain #, * and $
// - / in topic name separates the string into "topic levels"
// - # is a multi-level wildcard, and it must be the last character in the
//   topic name. It represents the parent and all children levels.
// - + is a single level wildcard. It must be the only character in the
//   topic level. It represents all names in the current level.
// - $ is a special character that says the topic is a system level topic
